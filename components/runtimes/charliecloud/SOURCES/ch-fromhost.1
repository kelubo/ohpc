.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This command is experimental. Features may be incomplete and/or buggy.
Please report any issues you find, so we can fix them!
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Inject files from the host into the Charliecloud image directory
\fBIMGDIR\fP\&.
.sp
The purpose of this command is to provide host\-specific files, such as GPU
libraries, to a container. It should be run after \fBch\-tar2dir\fP and
before \fBch\-run\fP\&. After invocation, the image is no longer portable to
other hosts.
.sp
Injection is not atomic; if an error occurs partway through injection, the
image is left in an undefined state. Injection is currently implemented using
a simple file copy, but that may change in the future.
.sp
By default, file paths that contain the strings \fB/bin\fP or \fB/sbin\fP
are assumed to be executables and placed in \fB/usr/bin\fP within the
container. File paths that contain the strings \fB/lib\fP or \fB\&.so\fP are
assumed to be shared libraries and are placed in the first\-priority directory
reported by \fBldconfig\fP (see \fB\-\-lib\-path\fP below). Other files are
placed in the directory specified by \fB\-\-dest\fP\&.
.sp
If any shared libraries are injected, run \fBldconfig\fP inside the
container (using \fBch\-run \-w\fP) after injection.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS To specify which files to inject

.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-dest DST\fP
Place files specified later in directory \fBIMGDIR/DST\fP, overriding the

and \fB\-\-dest\fP has not been specified, exit with an error. This can be
repeated to place files in varying destinations.

.SH --CRAY-MPI PREREQUISITES AND QUIRKS
.sp
The implementation of \fB\-\-cray\-mpi\fP for MPICH is messy, foul smelling,
and brittle. It replaces or overrides the open source MPICH libraries
installed in the container. Users should be aware of the following.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Containers must have the following software installed:
.INDENT 3.0
.IP a. 3
Open source \fI\%MPICH\fP\&.
.IP b. 3
\fI\%PatchELF with our patches\fP\&. Use the
\fBshrink\-soname\fP branch.
.IP c. 3
\fBlibgfortran.so.3\fP, because Cray’s \fBlibmpi.so.12\fP links to
it.
.UNINDENT
.IP 2. 3
Applications must be linked to \fBlibmpi.so.12\fP (not e.g.
\fBlibmpich.so.12\fP). How to configure MPICH to accomplish this is not
yet clear to us; \fBtest/Dockerfile.mpich\fP does it, while the Debian
packages do not.
.IP 3. 3
One of the \fBcray\-mpich\-abi\fP modules must be loaded when
\fBch\-fromhost\fP is invoked.
.IP 4. 3
Tested only for C programs compiled with GCC, and it probably won’t work
otherwise. If you’d like to use another compiler or another programming
language, please get in touch so we can implement the necessary support.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Please file a bug if we missed anything above or if you know how to make the
code better.
.SH NOTES
.sp
Symbolic links are dereferenced, i.e., the files pointed to are injected, not
the links themselves.
.sp
As a corollary, do not include symlinks to shared libraries. These will be
re\-created by \fBldconfig\fP\&.
.sp
There are two alternate approaches for nVidia GPU libraries:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Link \fBlibnvidia\-containers\fP into \fBch\-run\fP and call the
library functions directly. However, this would mean that Charliecloud
would either (a) need to be compiled differently on machines with and
without nVidia GPUs or (b) have \fBlibnvidia\-containers\fP available
even on machines without nVidia GPUs. Neither of these is consistent with
Charliecloud’s philosophies of simplicity and minimal dependencies.
.IP 2. 3
Use \fBnvidia\-container\-cli configure\fP to do the injecting. This
would require that containers have a half\-started state, where the
namespaces are active and everything is mounted but \fBpivot_root(2)\fP
has not been performed. This is not feasible because Charliecloud has no
notion of a half\-started container.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Further, while these alternate approaches would simplify or eliminate this
script for nVidia GPUs, they would not solve the problem for other situations.
.SH BUGS
.sp
File paths may not contain colons or newlines.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Place shared library \fB/usr/lib64/libfoo.so\fP at path
\fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP (assuming \fB/usr/lib\fP is the first directory
searched by the dynamic loader in the image), within the image
\fB/var/tmp/baz\fP and executable \fB/bin/bar\fP at path
\fB/usr/bin/bar\fP\&. Then, create appropriate symlinks to \fBlibfoo\fP and
update the \fBld.so\fP cache.

.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
.sp
This command was inspired by the similar \fI\%Shifter\fP feature
that allows Shifter containers to use the Cray Aires network. We particularly
appreciate the help provided by Shane Canon and Doug Jacobsen during our
implementation of \fB\-\-cray\-mpi\fP\&.
.sp
We appreciate the advice of Ryan Olson at nVidia on implementing
\fB\-\-nvidia\fP\&.
