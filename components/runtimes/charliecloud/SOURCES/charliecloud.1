.SH WHAT IS CHARLIECLOUD?
.sp
Charliecloud provides user\-defined software stacks (UDSS) for high\-performance
computing (HPC) centers. This “bring your own software stack” functionality
addresses needs such as:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
software dependencies that are numerous, complex, unusual, differently
configured, or simply newer/older than what the center provides;
.IP \(bu 2
build\-time requirements unavailable within the center, such as relatively
unfettered internet access;
.IP \(bu 2
validated software stacks and configuration to meet the standards of a
particular field of inquiry;
.IP \(bu 2
portability of environments between resources, including workstations and
other test and development system not managed by the center;
.IP \(bu 2
consistent environments, even archivally so, that can be easily, reliabily,
and verifiably reproduced in the future; and/or
.IP \(bu 2
usability and comprehensibility.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBWARNING: Cray CLE in recent versions\fP has a bug that crashes nodes when
cleaning up after some jobs, including if Charliecloud has been used. See the
installation instructions for a workaround.
.SH HOW DOES IT WORK?
.sp
Charliecloud uses Linux user namespaces to run containers with no privileged
operations or daemons and minimal configuration changes on center resources.
This simple approach avoids most security risks while maintaining access to
the performance and functionality already on offer.
.sp
Container images can be built using Docker or anything else that can generate
a standard Linux filesystem tree.
