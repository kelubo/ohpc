\subsection{Bring your own license} \label{sec:byol}
\OHPC{} provides a variety of integrated, pre-packaged elements from the
\IntelR{}~Parallel Studio XE software suite. Portions of the runtimes provided
by the included compilers and MPI components are freely usable. However, in
order to compile new binaries using these tools (or access other analysis tools
like \IntelR{}~Trace Analyzer and Collector, \IntelR{} Inspector, etc.) you
will need to provide your own valid license, and \OHPC{} adopts a {\em
 bring-your-own-license} model. Note that licenses are provided free of
charge for many categories of use. In particular, licenses for compilers and
developments tools are provided at no cost to academic researchers or
developers contributing to open-source software projects. More information on
this program can be found at:
