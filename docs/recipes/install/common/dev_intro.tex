The install procedure outlined in \S\ref{sec:basic_install} highlighted the
steps necessary to install a {\em master} host, assemble and customize a {\em
  compute} image, and provision several compute hosts from bare-metal. With

support a flexible HPC development environment including development tools,
C/C++/FORTRAN compilers, MPI stacks, and a variety of 3rd party libraries. The
following subsections highlight the additional software installation
procedures.
