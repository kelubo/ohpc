The suggested mount options shown for Lustre leverage the
\texttt{localflock} option. This is a
\href{http://wiki.lustre.org/Mounting_a_Lustre_File_System_on_Client_Nodes}{\color{blue}{Lustre-specific}}
setting that enables client-local flock support. It is much faster
than cluster-wide flock, but if you have an application requiring
cluster-wide, coherent file locks, use the standard \texttt{flock}
attribute instead.
