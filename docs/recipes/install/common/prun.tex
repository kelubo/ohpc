\OHPC{} includes a simple ``hello-world'' MPI application in the
\path{/opt/ohpc/pub/examples} directory that can be used for this
quick compilation and execution. \OHPC{} also provides a companion
job-launch utility named \texttt{prun} that is installed in concert
with the pre-packaged MPI toolchains. This convenience script provides
a mechanism to abstract job launch across different resource managers
and MPI stacks such that a single launch command can be
used for parallel job launch in a variety of \OHPC{} environments. It
also provides a centralizing mechanism for administrators to customize
desired environment settings for their users.
