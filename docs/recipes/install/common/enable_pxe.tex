\small Many server BIOS configurations have PXE network booting configured
as the primary option in the boot order by default. If your compute nodes have
a different device as the first in the sequence, the \texttt{ipmitool} utility
can be used to enable PXE.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[sms](*\#*) ipmitool -E -I lanplus -H ${bmc_ipaddr} -U root chassis bootdev pxe options=persistent
\end{lstlisting}
