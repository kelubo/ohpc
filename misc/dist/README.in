Many sites may find it useful or necessary to maintain a local copy of the
OpenHPC repositories. To facilitate this need, we provide downloadable tar
archives -- one containing a repository of binary packages as well as any
available updates, and one containing a repository of source RPMS. The tar file
also contains a small bash script to configure @PACKAGE_MANAGER@ to use the
local repository after download. To use, simply unpack the tarball where you
would like to host the local repository and execute the make_repo.sh script.

# ls /opt/ohpc/repos
@DISTRO@  mk_repo  OpenHPC-@VERSION@.@DISTRO@.@ARCH@.tar OpenHPC.local.repo

# ./make_repo.sh
--> Creating OpenHPC.local.repo file in @PACKAGE_MANAGER_DIR@
--> Local repodata stored in /opt/ohpc/repos

# cat @PACKAGE_MANAGER_DIR@/OpenHPC.local.repo
